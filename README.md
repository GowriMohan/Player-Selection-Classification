# Player-Selection-Classification


Problem Statement: Predicting the likelihood of a soccer player being selected for a team based on their skills, experience, and behavioral traits.

Background: Soccer teams often have to make difficult decisions when it comes to selecting players for a match or tournament. There are many factors that can influence these decisions, such as the player's age, physical abilities, technical skills, mental strength, and past performance. Additionally, a player's behavior both on and off the field can also be taken into consideration. However, it can be challenging for coaches and scouts to weigh all of these factors and make an informed decision about which players to select.

Objective: The objective of this problem is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a soccer player will be selected for a team, given a set of relevant features such as age, ball controlling skills, body reflexes, mental strength, and so on.

Data: The data for this problem consists of a dataset with columns including age, ball controlling skills, body reflexes, mental strength, goalkeeping skills, defending skills, passing skills, dribbling skills, shot accuracy, and other relevant features.

Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using a suitable metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. The model will be trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its generalization ability.
